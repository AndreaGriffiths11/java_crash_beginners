We will use on online java simulator:
[Java REPL](http://www.javarepl.com/console.html).  Nothing to download, just open in browser and GO!

We will be using Java, JDK version 8 download it here: [JAVA](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).  Download and install it (note there are some hidden 'accept' boxes you have to click before the download works)

And this is a fun learning tool we will use, it's called [Greenfoot](http://www.greenfoot.org/download).  Download and install it as well.
